'While FOSS is primarily about freedom and choice, certain choices are
known to carry an increased risk of breaking things in BunsenLabs.

Two of the riskier things are:
 * adding Ubuntu PPAs or unknown/untrusted repos to your
   /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d
 * installing a package that wants a newer version of libc6

More information on some of the riskier things, the above included,
