'"Hi $USER, "$"welcome to BunsenLabs Linux! :)

This is an optional post-installation script, designed to help you configure your new Linux installation and get the most out of BunsenLabs.

You will now be presented with a series of options. You will need your administrator (sudo) password, so please have it ready.

You will also need a working internet connection, so if you have not done so already, please configure your internet connection.

If you do not want to run this script now, you can run it at a later date by entering the command \"bl-welcome\" in your terminal."'
