'"Hi $USER, "$"welcome to BunsenLabs Linux! :)

This is an optional post-installation script to help you configure your new Linux installation and get the most out of BunsenLabs.

You will now be presented with a series of options. To see the output of a previous page, you can scroll back in the terminal.

If you do not want to run this script now, you can run it at a later date with the command \"bl-welcome\".

(Messages will be saved to ""$logfile"')
