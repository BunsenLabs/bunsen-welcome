bunsen-meta-printer-support
===========================

This metapackage will install the cups printing system, 
along with a selection of drivers.

It will also apply a change (via dpkg-divert) to 
the cups-browsed configuration file /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf,
to support IPP printers.

This line is uncommented:

CreateIPPPrinterQueues All

For more information, see:

https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=921252
https://lists.debian.org/debian-printing/2020/01/msg00073.html

The above configuration will probably become default in Debian Bullseye,
making this package's dpkg file diversion unnecessary.
