ADD_BACKPORTS_TEXT=$"Debian backports are packages taken from the next Debian release (called \"testing\"), adjusted and recompiled for usage on Debian stable.\
 If you enable this repository you will be able to upgrade some programs to newer versions, or install some programs not available in Debian stable.

However, backports cannot be tested as extensively as Debian stable, and are provided on an as-is basis, with risk of incompatibilities with other components in Debian stable.\
 It is therefore recommended to only select single backported packages that fit your needs, and not use all available backports.

This will add the line:

 deb $default_mirror stretch-backports main contrib non-free

to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-stretch-backports.list,
allowing you to upgrade or install packages using that repository."
