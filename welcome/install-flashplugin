However, while an increasing number of websites support alternative technologies, occasionally Flash is the only option.

 Chromium runs flash in a \"sandbox\" which keeps it somewhat isolated from the rest of the system.

 Firefox is not able to \"sandbox\" flash content, so is less secure, but this option might be more convenient for some people.
A necessary extra package browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash will be installed.
