To create a translation:
1) Copy cb-welcome.po
2) Edit it!
3) When done, run this command from this directory:
mkdir -p locale/LANGCODE/LC_MESSAGES
msgfmt -o locale/LANGCODE/LC_MESSAGES/cb-welcome.mo YOURTRANSLATION.po

where LANGCODE is something like 'en_GB' or 'de'. Don't forget to create that folder!
4) That's it :)

The whole process is explained here: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/098
