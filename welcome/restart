'"Hi $USER, "$"welcome back! :)

This welcome script has just been upgraded, so it has been restarted in case any files have changed.

You will be presented with a series of options. You will need your password, so please have it ready.

You will also need a working internet connection, so if you have not done so already, please configure your internet connection.

If you do not want to run this script now, you can run it at a later date by entering the command \"bl-welcome\" in your terminal.

(Messages will be saved to ""$logfile"')
