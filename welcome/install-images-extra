    $"BunsenLabs Beryllium comes with a set of background images,\
 including some from BunsenLabs Lithium, but\
 the wallpaper and other background images that were released\
 with BunsenLabs Hydrogen and Helium are also still available.

Would you like to install these other images from the BunsenLabs Image Archives package?\
