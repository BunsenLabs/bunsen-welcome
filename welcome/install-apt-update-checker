triggerInstallPage $"Apt Update Checker" \
    $"A package is available which will notify you of Debian packages which can be upgraded.\
 When upgrades are available, an icon wil be added to the system tray which\
 allows you to view the updates in a terminal window. You can then run any commands\
 of your choice, eg 'sudo apt upgrade' if you want to upgrade.

NOTE: No automatic package upgrades are done, but the Debian repository data is checked daily.

Would you like to install the update checker now?" \
